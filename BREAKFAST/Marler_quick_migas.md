# Marler's Quick Migas

This is the migas that I make for me and my wife when I'm being lazy and
don't want to cook anything complicated, but want more than just
scrambled eggs. You can adjust up and down to make more if you are
feeding more than just yourself. I find that one single serving bag of
fritos is good for up to a half dozen eggs. If you are making more than
that, start doubling the recipe accordingly. It's just migas ... it
won't blow up if you do it wrong, though I will if you add cheese.

## Ingredients

- 2-3 eggs
- 1/2 link of cheap chorizo (Get the cheapest stuff your grocer has.
 Ignore the artisan, localvore, hipster Chorizo.)
- 1 single serving size bag of Fritos (or a handful of corn chips,
 stale or fresh)
- Salsa (Use whatever is in your fridge, and as much as you can
 handle)
- Bacon (for eating while cooking, or to put in the Migas. I won't
 judge you either way.)

## Optional

- Potatoes (If you have some in the fridge, season liberally and throw
 them in)
- Fresh veggies (Tomato, jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, whatever you
 have and/or like)
- Mushrooms (I hate mushrooms, but you might not)
- More meat (If you have leftover BBQ, chicken, or anything else you
 don't know what to do with, throw it in there)
- Cheese

## Instructions

1. Use your favorite skillet for cooking eggs and heat it up
1. Take the chorizo out of it's inedible wrapper (you bought the cheap
 stuff, right? That casing is not edible) and put it in the pan
1. Chop up the chorizo with a spatula while it cooks until you get it
 into small chunks
1. Crack the eggs and put them into a plastic cup
1. Season the eggs with salt and pepper in the cup
1. Stir up the eggs with a fork until they are as blended as you like
 them to be
1. When the chorizo is done, pour in the eggs
1. Crush the fritos in the bag, then open the bag over the skillet and
 dump them in
1. Add the salsa to the skillet
1. Add anything else you want to add to cook with the eggs
1. Stir and chop with the spatula until the eggs are cooked as far as
 you like them cooked (I like my eggs dry as a Texas drought)
1. Remove skillet from heat and divide accordingly onto plates
1. If you have any fresh veggies you want to add for garnish, now is
 your chance to do so
1. Enjoy!

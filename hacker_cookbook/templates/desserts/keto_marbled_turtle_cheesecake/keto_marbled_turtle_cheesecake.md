# Keto Marbled Turtle Cheesecake

sl3dge in partnership with TheKetoBaker

Some tips for keeping a cheesecake from cracking on top: Don’t open the oven, and don’t over bake it! Opening the oven will cause a draft and in turn cause irregularities in the temperature, which makes the cheesecake crack. Over baking will dry it out and also make it crack.

## Ingredients

***You will need a 9″ Springform pan***

### crust

6 Tbsp of Butter
1/3 Cup of Swerve
2 Cups of Almond Flour
3 Tbsp of Cocoa Baking Powder
(A very small) Pinch of Salt

### Filling

4 Eggs
1 Cup of Swerve
1 Tsp of Vanilla Extract
3 8oz Packs of Cream Cheese
1/3 Cup of Sour Cream
2 Tbsp of Cocoa Baking Powder

### Caramel

4 Tbsp of Butter
1 Tbsp of Coconut Oil
4 Tbsp of Heavy Cream
1 tsp of Vanilla Extract
3 Tbsp of Swerve
A Pinch of Salt
1 Cup Pecans, roughly chopped

## Recipe

1. Crust- Preheat oven to 375 Degrees
2. Combine all ingredients well (I just used my hands to mix it because it’s easier than using a mixer or hand mixer)
3. Press the mix firmly into the bottom of your springform pan.
4. Bake for 8 minutes then let cool

### Filling Directions

Preheat oven to 350 Degrees, lightly grease the sides of your springform pan and place on baking sheet

1. Beat the cream cheese until it is nice and fluffy (about 3 minutes)
2. Beat in the sweetener, sour cream, and vanilla. Mix for about 3 minutes.
3. Gently add one egg at a time, mixing for about 1 minute in between each egg.
4. separate out 1 – 1 1/2 Cups of the filling into a separate bowl and add 2 Tbsp of Cocoa baking powder, mixing for about 1 minute.
5. Pour the regular mix into the springform pan. Add the chocolate mix in portions around the pan. Use a butter knife to carefully swirl the chocolate mix through the regular mix to create a marbled effect.
6. Bake for 40 – 45 minutes, or until it is puffy and golden around the edges.
7. Run a knife around the inside of the rim to loosen the cake, but let it cool for a while before removing the rim!
8. Cool the cake for 1-2 hours on a wire rack.

### Caramel Directions

Make sure to consistently whisk your caramel throughout the cooking process so it doesn’t burn!

1. Melt the butter in a small pan on medium heat and cook until it is golden brown. Add in the coconut oil and stir well.
2. Add in the heavy cream and stir until it is combined. lower the heat and simmer for about 1 minute.
3. Add in the sweetener, vanilla, and salt. Cook until it starts to get thicker and stickier.
4. Remove from heat and stir to make sure it isn’t separated, then pour over the cooled cheesecake. Sprinkle on the chopped pecans.
5. Chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours, then enjoy!

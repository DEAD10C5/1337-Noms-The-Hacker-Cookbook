# iHeartMalware's Buffalo Sauce Recipe

From Thanksgiving to Christmas, I made several pounds of wings using this sauce. I'm not a big fan of the "traditional" buffalo sauce, but this is enough of a difference to make it still good. In that month, I cooked over 20 pounds of wings, and all of them were eaten at the parties I cooked them for, except 12 wings.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Franks red hot
- 1 cup Valentina Mexican Hot Sauce (aka the big bottle of cheap stuff on the hispanic aisle)
- 2 sticks of butter

## Instructions

1. Start with a medium sized pot, and melt the butter over medium heat.
2. Once melted, add Franks and Valentina to the pot, and stir until it starts to simmer.
3. I'm a fan of Pioneer Woman's cooking method of frying then baking, so substitue the sauce and cook the wings according to her recipe: http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/wings/.

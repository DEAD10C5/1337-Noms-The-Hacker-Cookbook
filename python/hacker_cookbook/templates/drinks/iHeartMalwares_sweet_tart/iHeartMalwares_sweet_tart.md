# iHeartMalware's Sweet Tart Drink

Want a good cheap party drink? This is it.

## Ingredients

- 3 2-liters of Sunkist
- 3 packets of grape kool-aid
- 3 packets of cherry kool-aid
- 1 fifth of 190 proof Everclear (151 proof works too, or vodka, depending on what's legal in your state)

## Instructions

1. Pour out enough Sunkist of each bottle down to the label.
2. Add 1 packet of grape and 1 packet of cherry kool-aid to each bottle.
3. Split bottle of everclear between the 3 bottles.
4. Put top back on, and give it a quick turn. This is a very strong party drink, so keep that in mind.

Note: You can also add the Sunkist back to the containers and use this as a mixer. Tastes just like a sweet tart!

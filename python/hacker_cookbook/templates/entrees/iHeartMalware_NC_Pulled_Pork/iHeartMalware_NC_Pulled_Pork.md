# iHeartMalware's NC Style Pulled Pork Recipe

This is @iHeartMalware's NC Style pulled pork...cooked in a crock pot. This recipe has taken around 9 years to get it to this point, and has gone through many years of reverse engineering. I wanted to take the medium of a crock pot as I didn't have a smoker, nor did I have the time to sit and watch it.

## Ingredients

- 1 Boston Butt
- Dry Rub (pork rub)
- Yuengling, half bottle (or an IPA, drink the rest)
- 6 oz braggs apple cider vinegar
- BBQ Sauce (I usually use a SC bbq sauce, mustard based)
- Liquid smoke
- Plastic wrap

## Instructions

1. The night before, rub the butt down with the dry rub. Once covered, wrap with plastic wrap and store over night.
2. Put the pork butt in the crock pot and cook fat-side up. Next, split 6 oz of beer on each side, 6 oz of braggs on each side, and sprinkle with liquid smoke. cook for 8 hours on low or until easily pulled away with a fork.
3. After 8 hours, pull pork, separating the fat, bone, and meat. Save ¼ cup of the juice from cooking. Once pulled, empty the crock pot, then add the meat back in and toss with the ¼ cup of juice, ¼ cup of bbq sauce, and ¼ cup of apple cider vinegar. Place on low for 30 minutes, then warm for another 30. (if you can stand it)

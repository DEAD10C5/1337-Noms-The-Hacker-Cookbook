# Hashbrownpatty Bacon Sandwich

Play with your food and then eat it!

## Ingredients

* 2x Standard issue Hashbrownpatties
* A few strips of bacon

## Instructions

* Place the hashbrownpatties adjacent to one another as if they were slices of bread (keep in mind the context : you are about to make a sandwich)
* Tear the strips of bacon into smaller pieces so that if one slice is placed lengthwise across a hashbrownpatty there isn't too much overflow (hacker discretion is advised only at the advice of a hacker)
* Place your bacon kilobytes (these are much larger than bacon bits) on the bottom hashbrownpatty
* Place the top hashbrownpatty on top of the bacon kilobytes

## Tips n' Tricks

* Please don't put ketchup on it.

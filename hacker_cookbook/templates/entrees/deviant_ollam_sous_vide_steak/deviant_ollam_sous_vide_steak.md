# Deviant Ollam's Sous Vide Steak

a simple set of details, but created after loads of testing and tweaking over time, often in hotel rooms.

## Supplies

- Sous vide immersion circulator (the Anova and the Joule are my two favorites)
- Heavy duty zip-loc bags (freezer bag thickness)
- Searzall or cast iron over hot stove

## Ingredients

- Ribeye steaks (ideally ribeye cap, ideally USDA prime)
- Large grain french grey sea salt
- Cracked and ground black pepper
- Bay leaves
- Liquid aminos
- Butter from grass-fed cows
- High smoke point oil such as avocado oil or extra light olive oil (optional)

## Instructions

1. Bring your water bath up to 126.5 degrees Fahrenheit (52.5 decrees Celsius).
2. Remove steak from butcher's packaging and, while still cold, apply heat (either Searzall or via stove top cast iron with high smoke point oil) to sear all sides (this is known as the "pre-sear" method).
3. Place pre-seared (but still uncooked) steak into heavy duty ziploc bag, along with a pinch of french grey sea salt, one pinch of cracked black pepper, one pinch of ground black pepper, two bay leaves, and three squirts of liquid aminos.  (optional: a small drizzle of your oil can go in the bag, mostly to help with heat transfer and eliminating air pockets).
4. Use the "sous vide water immersion technique" to remove air from the bag... slowly lower the bagged food into your water bath, letting the pressure of the water force the air out through the top of the bag.  once the air is out of the bag, carefully seal it just above the water line.
5. The temperature of your water bath may drop slightly as the cold meat bag is exposed to the water, but allow the immersion circulator to bring the water bath back up to temperature.  once the target temperature is reached, keep the bag in the bath for a duration calculated as "30 minutes for each finger of thickness of steak" ... that is to say, if you have a three-finger steak, you'd keep it rolling in the sous vide bath for 90 minutes.  (NOTE: these times are just a minimum.  it is entirely safe to keep a sous vide cook process running for hours or even days as long as the temperature is above 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 decrees Celsius).
6. After your minimum cook time has been achieved, you are free to remove the steak whenever it is time to serve.  remove the bag from the sous vide bath and open it over a sink or other receptacle as you use tongs to remove your now-cooked steak.  take care to not bring any large peppercorns or bay leaves with the steak.  (NOTE: if you cooked for more than six hours, there is a chance that much of the steak has broken down and is extra tender... take caution that it doesn't fall apart... use quality tongs).
7. Bonus pro step: place whatever dishes will be used for serving and dining into the still-hot water bath to allow them to warm up while you finish the steak execution.
8. Pat the steak dry slightly as you prepare to again use the hot cast iron or to use the Searzall.  sprinkle a pinch of ground black pepper and french grey sea salt on all sides and rub it in slightly.
9. Sear all sides of the steak again. A nice, solid sear.
10. Plate the steak on your now-warm dishware. Rest a generous pat of the grass-fed cow butter atop and let it begin to melt.  serve quickly, so that the already-limited heat in the steak does not dissipate too much.  suggested sides: asparagus, broad beans, mashed cauliflower, or mushrooms saut√©ed in butter.
enjoy!

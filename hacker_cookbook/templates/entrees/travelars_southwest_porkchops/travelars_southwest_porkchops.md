# @Travelar's Southwest Style Pork Chops

A tasty meal with little prep time. I looked at a number of similar recipes and took what I liked about them and began to experiment. This is what I came up with.

## Ingredients

* 4-6 thick-cut pork chops
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 tablespoons lime juice
* 1 24 oz jar of your favorite salsa

Use optional spices for an added bit of heat.

## Instructions

1. Combine ground cumin, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl. Use the spice mixture as a rub and coat both sides of the chops.
2. Heat the oil in a heavy frying pan. Add the pork chops and cook over medium heat until browned, which should be about 3-4 minutes per side.
3. Place the pork chops into the slow cooker and pour lime juice. Let sit for 1-2 minutes. Pour in the jar of salsa and cook on high for 2-3 hours.
4. Serve hot, with a bit of salsa spooned over each pork chop. Pork chops should be tender enough that they will fall apart with just a fork.

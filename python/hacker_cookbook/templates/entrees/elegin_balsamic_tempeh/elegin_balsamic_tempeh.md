Depending on baking dish size it is usually easier to double the recipe. Use this as protien replacement in dish where flavor profile fits or have as snacks.

## Notes

- you can get away with 2 hours of marinating but longer can be better if time permits. I have personally not been able to differentiate between like 6 and 12 hours.  I usually prep this in morning and put it in fridge.
- might want make sure the dish is at roomish temperature before putting in oven.
- clean dish sooner than later

Quick prep and only oven time for cooking. For a quick meal add some quinoa or wild rice with a vegetable of choice.

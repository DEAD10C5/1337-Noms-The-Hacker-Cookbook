# "Excuse to Eat Bacon" Avocado Sandwich

by @boredsilly

My wife used to crave avocado sandwiches while she was pregnant but they were too plain for me.  That inspired me to kick them up to an unhealthy level so I could enjoy them too. It also gave me another delivery mechanism for bacon.

## Ingredients

- Bacon
- Cracked black pepper
- 1 ripe avocado
- 1 small red onion
- Alfalfa sprouts
- Mayonnaise
- Hot sauce (Like Tapatio)
- 2 slices of your favorite bread or toast
- Salt (optional)

## Instructions

1. Crack the black pepper over several slices of bacon (at least 2) and cook until crispy.
2. Mix the hot sauce into the mayonnaise and spread evenly over both slices of bread.
3. Cut the avocado in half, remove pit, and then slice the flesh into 1/2 inch slices.
4. Scoop the slices out of the avocado shell and cover the first slice of bread with them.
5. Cut the red onion into thin slices and put those atop the avocado slices.
6. Add the bacon. **Do it now.**
7. Rinse and dry the alfalfa sprouts then make a thin blanket over the bacon.
8. **Optional** - Dust the sprouts with salt to amplify your blood pressure increase from the bacon.
9. Top with the other slice of bread and enjoy.

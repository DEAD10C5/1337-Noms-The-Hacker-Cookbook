# @hardwaterhacker's Crispy Parmesan Baked Walleye

This recipe works great for walleye, crappie/sunfish/bluegill (a.k.a. bream), northern pike, or any other similar freshwater, non-oily white meat fish.

Serves: 2-4

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs. (.9 kg) walleye fillets
- 2 cups (300 g) panko bread crumbs
- 1 packet dry Italian dressing mix (I use Good Seasons)
- 1/4 cup (38 g) garlic powder
- Pinch of kosher salt
- Fresh ground black pepper to taste
- 2 Tbsp (30 mL) butter
- 2 egg whites
- 1/2 cup (120 mL) skim milk
- 1/2 cup (45 g) finely-grated quality parmesan cheese

## Preparation

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C)

1. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Tinfoil can be used, but fish may stick.
2. Mix panko crubs, seasoning packet, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl until mixed well.
3. Beat egg whites and skim milk in a bowl until blended.
4. Dunk fillet pieces in egg & milk mixture and then dredge in breading mixture.  Make sure each piece is thoroughly coated and place on parchment paper.
5. Bake fillets for 15 minutes.

While fillets are baking, melt butter in a pan.  After 15 minutes, remove fish from oven and spoon a small amount of butter on each fillet.  Sprinkle grated parmesan on each fillet.  Place fish back in oven for 3-4 minutes until parmesan is melted.

![](brusselsprouts.jpg)

This is one of my wife's favorite sides and even if you hate brussel sprouts, this might be your opportunity the change your mind. Feeds 5-6

## Ingredients

- 1 pkg frozen brussel sprouts or 12-14 fresh brussel sprouts
- 1/2 cup dried cranberries
- 2 tbsp salt
- 4 tbps Butter
- 2-3 tbsp Brown Sugar
- 1 shot of your favorite whiskey/bourbon
- Torch or stick lighter. Don't use a regular lighter. You'll lose arm hair. 

## Instructions

Prepare your brussel sprouts depending on the option you picked above:

Frozen (quick option): 
	a. Nuke 'em as directed on the package.
	b. Melt helf the butter in frying pan or wok
	c. Increase heat to Medium and add sprouts. Too much heat will burn the butter. 
	d. Let them brown a little on the outside then proceed to step 2. 

Fresh (tasty option):
	a. Cut sprouts in half and place them on a baking sheet with cut side up. Cover with foil for easy cleanup. 
	b. Drizzle olive oil over each and sprinkle with a light layer of salt. 
	c. Bake @ 400F for 20-30 min. Add more time (~10min) if you like them crispy!
	d. Melt half the butter in a frying pan or wok on Low-Medium heat. Too much heat will burn the butter. 
	e. Add the sprouts and proceed to Step 2. 

1. Add brown sugar, dried cranberries, and remaining 2 tbps of butter. 
2. Stir on Low-Medium heat until all the brown sugar has disolved. 
3. Toss in the shot of whiskey. Count to 3. Stand back and light it. The flames will go out once all the alcohol has burned off. (Make sure the cooking area is free of dry material with a high surface area. It'll be tough trying to explain that one to the fire marshall.)
4. Now that the fire is out, transfer the sprouts and the Vorpal Glaze of Awesomeness to a serving dish or directly to the plate. 

Great with red meat and red wine.

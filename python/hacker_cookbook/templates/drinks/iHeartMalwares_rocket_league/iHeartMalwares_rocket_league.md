# iHeartMalware's Rocket League

Lots of rocket league was played while drinking this. This is also a good all-around-fruity drink that is...dangerous. Like a rocket...league.

## Ingredients

- 16 oz glass
- Blue raspberry vodka (I like Svedka)
- Blue curacao
- Mango / peach juice
- Pineapple Juice
- Orange Bitters

## Instructions

1. Fill glass 3/4 of the way with ice.
2. Fill glass between 1/3 and 1/2 with raspberry vodka. (depending on taste)
3. Splash of blue curacao. Don't go too heavy!
4. Fill < 1/4 of the way with mango / peach juice.
5. Fill > 1/4 of pineapple juice. (You'll want a smidge more pineapple than the mango / peach)
6. Add 7 dashes of orange bitters, and stir
7. Stir and drink! It should be somewhere between green and blue. If it's green...you did it right. If blue...go lighter on the curacao!

Note: This is one of those "you don't taste the alcohol" drinks, but it still has a high content. So be careful. :)

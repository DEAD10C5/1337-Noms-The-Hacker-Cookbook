# The Secret Ingredient The Feds Don't Want You to Know About
This ingredient is something the feds don't want you to know about. As I type this, the FDA surveillance van is parked right outside my house. Before the nanny state arrives to curb stomp me, I need to tell you about a secret illegal ingredient called the Tonka bean. They're used in other countries the same way vanilla is used, but in the USA, they're illegal to sell as a food because they contain coumarin, which is toxic in disgustingly excessive quantities. Remember that most spices are toxic in disgustingly excessive quantities. Plants used for spices make these chemicals to poison their predators, and humans are the only species crazy enough to make a delicacy out of poison. Way to stick it to nature, guys. 

You can still buy tonka beans, but not for human consumption. Online they are often labeled as ingredients for Wiccan magick spells. Like they can grant wishes or something. 

# I Wish for Whipped Cream
Whipped cream is a good way to familiarize yourself with tonka beans as an ingredient. Before the feds haul you off to prison, you'll see that you only need to use a miniscule quantity of tonka bean to alter the flavor of a large bowl of whipped cream. The flavor of tonka seems to be much more potent in fat based dishes, and you won't get the same effect if you put tonka bean shavings in, say, tea. It's very easy to overdo the tonka in whipped cream so you should start out with less.

WARNING: this recipe can be multiplied, but you may experience toxicity from the tonka beans if you eat 200 of these dishes. BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!

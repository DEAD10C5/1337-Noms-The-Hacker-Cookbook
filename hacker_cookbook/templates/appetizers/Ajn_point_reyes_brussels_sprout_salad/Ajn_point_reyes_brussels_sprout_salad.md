# Ajn's Point Reyes Brussel Sprout Salad

The key is absolutely the mild flavor of this cheese from a creamery in Calfornia.  Been meaning to try cambazola for fun, but haven't yet had the chance.  Here goes...

## Ingredients

- 1/3-1/2lb uncooked, untrimmed Brussels sprouts
- 1 tbsp+ high quality olive oil
- 1 tbsp maple syrup
- 1 tbsp grainy mustard
- 2-3ish oz Point Reyes blue cheese, room temp
- 1/2 Bosc pear, sliced thin and halved
- Handful of lightly candied walnuts (optional)
- Salt & pepper
- 1 Tbsp of Apple Cider Vinegar

## Instructions

1. Insert a fork into the stem end of each sprout, and shred on a mandolin slicer moving in a single direction until only the portion you would have trimmed is left.  Consistency is key here; you want light, shredded bits with some thinly sliced core pieces
2. In a large bowl, mix oil, syrup, mustard and blue cheese with a fork, mashing the cheese until smooth and integrated.  You could use a food processor, but I find this easier.  Balance cheese/oil/mustard to your preference, along with light salt/pepper.
3. Mix in sprouts until you achieve a dressing:sprout ratio you like.  We prefer it pretty thin on dressing.  Add pears and sprinkle with walnuts.  Serve with grilled beef/pork/lamb.

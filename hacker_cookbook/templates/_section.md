![hacked](https://www.bitsmasher.net/tmp/hacked.jpeg)


This is a collaborative effort. The goal is to collect recipes for an eclectic mix of dishes from around the hacker community. Tell us about your favorite recipe or something you like to make with your own unique twist. Feel free to include a recommendation for booze pairing.

General questions should be directed to [@mzbat](https://twitter.com/mzbat) or [@iheartmalware](https://twitter.com/iheartmalware).

We can't promise that all submissions will be included in the final printed book. We do plan to leave this repo up indefinitely. We intend to give proceeds from any sales of printed book to [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://supporters.eff.org/shop).

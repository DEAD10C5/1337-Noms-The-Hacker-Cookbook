## Recipe

- Mix all of the dry ingredients first

- Slowly pour and mix the milk into the saucepan. Increase heat if needed but be careful the milk should not boil!
- Once you're satisfied remove the saucepan from the heat.
- Mix in the vanilla extract into the saucepan
- Split the hot cocoa between two mugs
- Add half and half to each mug

## (Optional Steps)

- Add marshmallows to each mug
- Apply whipped cream in a circular fashion to each mug
- Take a small amount of cocoa powder onto a spoon and tap the spoon slightly to sprinkle cocoa powder on top of the whipped cream.
- Repeat the above step but for cinnamon powder.
- Add sprinkles!! :D
- Enjoy!

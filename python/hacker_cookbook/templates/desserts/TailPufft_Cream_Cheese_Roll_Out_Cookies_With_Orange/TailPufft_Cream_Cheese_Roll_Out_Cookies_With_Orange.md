# TailPufft's Cream Cheese Roll Out Cookies with Orange

## Cookies

- 1 cup butter - close to room tempterature
- 1 8 pz. package of cream cheese - room temperature
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 2 eggs
- 4 tsp. frozen orange juice concentrate
- Zest of 1 orange
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 tsp. almond extract
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 5 cups flour
- Extra flour for dusting

## Icing Recipe

- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 tbsp. milk
- 1 tbsp. light corn syrup
- 1 drop lemon juice

## Directions

A. Pre-heat oven to 350
1. Cream together butter and sugar. Don't rush the creaming together of the butter and sugar step, otherwise the 
pastry gods will find you and they will punish you.
Whisk in cream cheese. Whisk in eggs.
Add all the other wet stuff.
Add in the orange zest too.
You now have a bucket o' orange smelling buttery wet stuff
2. Mix all the dry stuff seperately.
3. Slowly incorporate the dry mixture into the wet mixture. Go ahead and curse a bit for not doing this in a larger sized bowl and go find a larger bowl. I'll wait.
B. Do not do this in your Kitchenaid mixer as 5 cups of flour is too much for it and I will not bring you Kleenex for your tears when you fry your Kitchenaid motor. (at most, mix up to 3 cups of flour in the wet mixture using the paddle kitchenaid attachment, but then mix the last two cups of flour in by hand.)
4. Take this lovely smelling rather firm lump of dough, divide it into two squirrel sized lumps and chill.
5. After about 20-30 minutes, take out chilly dough squirrel number 1 and dust the counter with flour. Roll out the dough to about 1 fat centimeter of thickness. Use lots of sprinkles of flour to keep the dough from sticking to your rolling pin and / or the counter. This dough gets stickier the warmer it gets, so try to keep it nice and cold, like my heart.
6. Go nuts with the cookie cutters. Don't let anyone give you any crap for owning too many cookie cutters. This recipe holds shapes well throughout baking.
C. This will make more cookies than you have patience to clean up after. This will make more cookies than your children will have the attention span to decorate.
D. If you decide to freeze chilly dough squirrel number 2 for later, have at it. This dough freezes very well.

## Baking

1. Either grease cookie sheets or use parchment paper. Is the oven on? Put the whiskey down and turn the oven on.
2. Keep an eye on these suckers as it is a pretty quick bake. I would check them after 8 minutes, but usually take about 10 minutes for a variety of sizes. We make little bats for Christmas. Christmas bats take about 8 minutes. Very lightely golden at the edges means they are done.
3. Enjoy watching various stages of cookies take over every single horizontal surface of your house.

## Icing

1. Let the cookies cool, as putting icing on hot cookies will cause the icing to make a mess.
2. Mix everything together, then put on cookies. Or just dip the cookies in the icing.

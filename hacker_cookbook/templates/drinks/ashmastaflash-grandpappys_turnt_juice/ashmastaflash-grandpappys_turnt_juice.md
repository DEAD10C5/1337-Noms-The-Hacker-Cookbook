# Grandpappy's Turnt Juice

## A cocktail inspired by October in Southeast Tennessee.

There's a chill in the air.  The smell of the season's first blaze in the
fireplace is on the breeze.  Winter is coming to the Appalachian foothills.
Put down the axe and pack some cherry blend into your burl wood pipe.  Let's
sip on some of Grandpappy's Turnt Juice.

Not for the faint of heart, or the faint of pancreas.  If you need to shoot
your blood sugar through the roof and take the edge way off, this is the drink
for you.
